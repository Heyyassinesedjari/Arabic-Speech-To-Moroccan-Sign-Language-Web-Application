## **Documentation & Code Quality TODOs**

- **Add/Improve Docstrings:**  
  Write clear, concise docstrings for every class, method, and function.  
  *Why?* Helps others (and future you) understand what each part does.

- **Add Comments Where Logic Is Complex:**  
  Use inline comments for tricky or non-obvious code sections.  
  *Why?* Makes code easier to maintain and debug.

- **Document Setup and Usage:**  
  Ensure `README.md` explains how to install dependencies, run the app, and use its features.  
  *Why?* Essential for users, recruiters, and collaborators.

- **Add Example Data and Results:**  
  Include sample inputs/outputs, screenshots, or demo videos.  
  *Why?* Showcases your project’s capabilities.

## **Testing & Validation TODOs**

- **Add Unit and Integration Tests:**  
  Write tests for all major functions and edge cases.  
  *Why?* Ensures reliability and makes refactoring safer.

- **Handle Edge Cases in Data Processing:**  
  Make sure your code gracefully handles unexpected input, missing files, or corrupted data.  
  *Why?* Prevents crashes and improves robustness.

- **Add Data Validation and Preprocessing:**  
  Validate and clean input data before processing.  
  *Why?* Improves accuracy and reliability.

## **Logging & Error Handling TODOs**

- **Add Logging:**  
  Replace print statements with Python’s `logging` module.  
  *Why?* Enables better monitoring and debugging, especially in production.

- **Improve Error Handling:**  
  Use try/except blocks and user-friendly error messages.  
  *Why?* Prevents silent failures and helps users understand issues.

## **OOP & Design Principles TODOs**

- **Refactor for SOLID Principles:**  
  Review classes for Single Responsibility, Open/Closed, Liskov Substitution, Interface Segregation, and Dependency Inversion.  
  *Why?* Makes code modular, extensible, and maintainable.

- **Add Type Hints:**  
  Use Python type hints for function arguments and return values.  
  *Why?* Improves readability and helps with static analysis.

- **Add Private Methods Where Applicable:**  
  Prefix internal helper methods with `_` to indicate they’re not part of the public API.  
  *Why?* Clarifies intended usage and reduces accidental misuse.

---

## **Security TODOs**

- **Add Configuration Management:**  
  Use `.env` files or config files for secrets and environment-specific settings.  
  *Why?* Keeps sensitive info out of code and supports multiple environments.

- **Review .gitignore:**  
  Ensure sensitive files (like `.env`, data dumps, and compiled files) are not tracked by Git.  
  *Why?* Prevents accidental leaks and keeps the repo clean.

---

## **CI/CD & Deployment TODOs**

- **Implement CI/CD:**  
  Make sure `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and `cd.yml` run automated tests and deployments.  
  *Why?* Ensures code quality and smooth deployment.

- **Containerize the Application:**  
  Keep Dockerfile and docker-compose.yml up-to-date and tested.  
  *Why?* Makes deployment and sharing easier.

---

## **Dependency & Environment TODOs**

- **Review and Clean Up Dependencies:**  
  Remove unused packages from `requirements.txt` and ensure all needed packages are listed.  
  *Why?* Reduces bloat and avoids dependency issues.

---

## **Frontend & UX TODOs**

- **Improve Frontend UX:**  
  Polish `templates/index.html` and static files for a better user experience.  
  *Why?* Makes your project more appealing to users and recruiters.

---

## **Scalability & Performance TODOs**

- **Optimize Code (After Cleaning):**  
  Profile and optimize performance-critical sections (e.g., video concatenation, model inference).  
  *Why?* Ensures your app can handle more data and users.

- **Prepare for Scalability:**  
  Consider how the app would scale with more users, data, or larger models.  
  *Why?* Shows you can design for growth.

---

## **Data/AI/ML-Specific TODOs**

- **Add Model Evaluation Metrics:**  
  Include scripts or notebooks showing model accuracy, speed, etc.  
  *Why?* Demonstrates your data science skills.

- **Showcase Data Analysis Skills:**  
  Add a notebook or script for exploratory data analysis (EDA).  
  *Why?* Highlights your analytical abilities.

- **Document ML Pipeline:**  
  Clearly explain your ML pipeline (data collection, preprocessing, training, inference).  
  *Why?* Shows your end-to-end understanding.

- **Add Experiment Tracking:**  
  Use MLflow or logs to track model versions and experiments.  
  *Why?* Demonstrates professional ML workflow.

- **Prepare for Deployment:**  
  Add notes or scripts for deploying the model as an API (Flask, FastAPI, Docker).  
  *Why?* Shows you can take models to production.

## **How to Use These TODOs**

- Place relevant TODOs at the top of each file as comments.
- Keep a master TODO list in `TODO.md` (tracked by Git).
- Regularly review and update as you progress.

## **What SHouldn't be tracked by Git**
- Remove from Git history ever file that shouldn't be tracked
