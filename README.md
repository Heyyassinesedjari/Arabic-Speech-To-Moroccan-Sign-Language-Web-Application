## An operational web application that interprets spoken Arabic into Moroccan Sign Language videos, enabling seamless communication for the hearing-impaired..

This project is a part of my end of 2nd year project at [ENSIAS](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89cole_nationale_sup%C3%A9rieure_d%27informatique_et_d%27analyse_des_syst%C3%A8mes), [Mohammed V University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mohammed_V_University). When exploring potential project ideas, Professor [M. Naoum](http://ensias.um5.ac.ma/professor/m-mohamed-naoum) suggested creating a mobile app to facilitate communication between the Moroccan deaf community and individuals who can hear. After a brief review on platforms like Github and Google Scholar, I noticed a focus on converting sign language videos into written or spoken English using CNNs in existing projects. However, there were limited solutions in the reverseâ€”translating spoken language into sign language, especially addressing Arabic speech and Moroccan Sign Language.

Motivated by this insight, I embarked on the project myself, initiating with a basic web application featuring a limited set of Moroccan Sign Language words. This serves as a starting point for open-source contributors in Morocco, a primary focus of this project.

Looking ahead, I plan to evolve this into a mobile application, expanding the range of Moroccan signs to cover more everyday spoken vocabulary.

Additionally, I aim to develop an automatic speech recognition model specifically for the Moroccan dialect. This broader approach could benefit around 40 million potential users, catering to those who speak the dialect but not formal Arabic. The goal remains to create a comprehensive solution meeting the communication needs of the Moroccan market.

Every part of this project is sample code which shows how to do the following:

* Create a speech to video translating Arabic Speech (AS) to Moroccan Sign Language (MSL) using Python.
* Create a Messenger like web application using Flask, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
